                <h2>Email Verification</h2>
                <p>
                    Added email verification to the registration flow today. Up until now, anyone could register with any email address and immediately get access — fine for development, but definitely not something I'd want going to production. Now when you register, you get a 6-digit code sent to your email and you have to enter it before your account activates.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the backend, I added an <code>EmailVerification</code> model that stores the code with a 15-minute expiry and a max of 5 attempts. Registration now creates users as inactive (<code>is_active=False</code>), and the verify endpoint activates them and returns tokens. There's also a resend endpoint with a 60-second cooldown so people can't spam it. If someone tries to log in before verifying, they get a specific error that tells the iOS app to redirect them to the verification screen instead of just showing a generic failure.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The iOS side was where the interesting bugs showed up. The first version looked like it worked, but when I actually tested it on the simulator, registering just kicked me back to the login screen. Turned out there were three interrelated issues: ContentView was destroying the registration NavigationStack when <code>isLoading</code> toggled (because it used that flag for the splash screen), DRF's <code>ValidationError</code> was wrapping the login guard's response values in arrays that iOS couldn't decode, and DRF field errors like <code>{"email": ["already exists"]}</code> weren't being parsed at all. Fixed all three — separated <code>isCheckingAuth</code> from <code>isLoading</code>, moved the login guard to return a proper <code>Response()</code> instead of raising <code>ValidationError</code>, and added a fallback parser for DRF's field error format.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    575 backend tests (38 new) and 116 iOS tests (8 new), all passing. Staff invites still bypass verification since the invite email itself is the proof of ownership.

                <h2>React Admin SPA</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally got to the frontend. After nine steps of backend-only work, today I built the React admin SPA from scratch. Scaffolded a Vite + React 19 + TypeScript project at <code>backend/admin_frontend/</code>, wired up Tailwind v4 with all the design tokens from STYLES.md, and set up ESLint 9 and Prettier per the code standards doc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The app has four pages: login, dashboard, audiobook list, and import. The login page checks that you're a staff user before letting you in. Dashboard shows stat cards (total audiobooks, chapters, segments, tagging pipeline breakdown) plus a recent imports table — I added a new backend endpoint for that so the frontend doesn't have to fetch everything and count it itself. The audiobook list has search and pagination, and the import page lets you search LibriVox and import books with one click.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For auth I built a JWT interceptor with a refresh token mutex — if your access token expires mid-request, it refreshes once and replays any queued requests. If the refresh fails, you get kicked to login. The whole thing proxies through Vite's dev server so there's no CORS hassle.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Had to install Node.js first since it wasn't on the machine yet (quick <code>brew install node</code>). Also learned that eslint-plugin-react-hooks v7 has a new <code>set-state-in-effect</code> rule that's pretty strict — had to restructure the AuthContext to initialize loading state from localStorage synchronously instead of setting it in the effect body.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    27 source files, 201 backend tests passing (5 new for the dashboard stats endpoint), and all frontend lint/format/typecheck clean. Next up is Step 11: the tagging tool with wavesurfer.js.

                <h2>Backend Foundation + Pre-Screening Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Cranked through all the backend foundation steps today — models, auth, catalog, LibriVox import, and filter API. The entire backend is now in place.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Started with the database models. Built out Author, Genre, Audiobook, and Chapter in the catalog app, plus FilterCategory and FilterSegment in the filtering app. Used <code>DecimalField</code> for segment timestamps to avoid float rounding issues during playback. Wrote a seed migration for all 7 filter categories and got everything registered in Django admin. Then built the auth API (register, login, token refresh, profile, password change) and the catalog API (audiobook list with search/filtering, detail with chapters, stream URLs).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Step 5 was the LibriVox import service — search their API, import a full audiobook with authors, genres, and chapters, all idempotent. Caught a few quirks where the real LibriVox API didn't match the reference docs I'd written. Imported books default to unpublished so an admin has to review them first.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Wrapped up with Step 6 — the Filter API. Two sets of endpoints: iOS-facing ones that return filter categories and segments grouped by chapter (only <code>manual</code> and <code>ai_confirmed</code>, with <code>?category=</code> and <code>?severity=</code> filters), and admin endpoints for full segment CRUD plus bulk create. The severity filter is "at or above" so <code>?severity=moderate</code> returns moderate and severe. Bulk create returns 201 or 207 multi-status depending on whether all segments pass validation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the backend foundation locked in at 140 tests, I kept going and started the LLM pre-screening pipeline — the system that automatically identifies objectionable content so admins don't have to tag everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Built the <code>TranscriptionService</code> first. It wraps faster-whisper to transcribe chapter audio into text with word-level timestamps. Lazy-loads the Whisper model so it's not eating memory at import time, handles downloading audio to a temp file, runs transcription, and tracks status through PENDING to PROCESSING to COMPLETED/FAILED. It's idempotent — if a chapter already has a completed transcript it just returns it. Failed transcripts can be retried too, which meant clearing the old error message on retry (caught that one in tests).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then built the <code>ContentAnalysisService</code>, which runs a two-stage analysis. Stage 1 is a deterministic word-list scan — match each word against a JSON file of profanity, slurs, and blasphemy. Fast and reliable. Stage 2 sends the transcript to Ollama in 30-second chunks with 5-second overlap, asking the LLM to identify violence, sexual content, crude humor, and other stuff a word list can't catch. The LLM returns structured JSON with category, severity, and word indices that get mapped back to timestamps. If Ollama is down or returns garbage JSON, it logs a warning and moves on — no crashes. Both services create <code>FilterSegment</code> records with <code>source='ai_suggested'</code> so admins can review and confirm them in the tagging tool later.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    171 tests passing now (31 new, all mocked — no actual Whisper or Ollama calls). Lint clean. Next up is Step 9: pipeline orchestration to wire the services together with admin API endpoints and a management command.

                <h2>Finishing the Planning Phase</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally knocked out the last two planning items today — the UI style guide and code standards. For the visual design, I went with a dark and immersive look inspired by Spotify and Audible. Kept the teal from my earlier iOS prototype as the primary brand color and added a teal-to-navy gradient for special moments like the player screen.

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>
                    For fonts, I'm using SF Pro on iOS (system default, so no bundling needed) and Inter for the web admin. Inter is a geometric sans-serif that's clean and highly legible — perfect for dense UI like the tagging tool.
                </p>
                <div style="background: #1E232E; padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px; margin: 16px 0; font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, sans-serif;">

                    <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600; color: #fff; margin: 8px 0;">Heading Semibold 600</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; color: #A1A7B4; margin: 8px 0;">Body text in regular weight — this is what most content will look like.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 500; color: #6B7280; margin: 8px 0;">CAPTION MEDIUM 500 — timestamps, metadata</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>Code Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    For code standards, I set up Ruff for Python (it's insanely fast and replaces like five other tools), ESLint 9 with the new flat config for TypeScript, and SwiftLint via SPM for Swift. Also established a strict rule: no direct commits to main. Everything goes through a PR. Pre-commit hooks will auto-format and lint on every commit so we catch issues before they hit the repo.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With this done, the entire planning phase is complete. PLAN.md has all 12 detailed sections, plus now STYLES.md and CODE_STANDARDS.md. I'm actually ready to start writing code. Next session I'll scaffold the Django backend and get the first models in place.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Dev Log Site Redesign</h3>
                <p>
                    While I was at it, I figured it made sense to update this dev log site to match the new style guide. The old design was using a cream background with coral accents and like four different fonts — it looked fine but didn't match where the project is headed. So I rewrote the CSS to use the same dark theme and design tokens from STYLES.md. Now it's got the dark base background, the teal brand color in the header, card-style posts with the elevated background, and Inter as the only font. Added some nice touches like smooth hover transitions on the nav and pagination, plus proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation. It's a small thing but having visual consistency across everything — even the dev log — makes the project feel more cohesive.

                <h2>Back at it - Full Architecture Plan Complete</h2>
                <p>
                    It's been a while. School and life got in the way, but I'm finally back on Audio Nexus and I came back with a completely different mindset. Instead of just jumping into code like I did before, I sat down and planned the entire system top to bottom. I went back through every single prototype repo I've built over the last year and a half — the Tkinter desktop app, the FastAPI server, the Kivy admin, the UIKit prototype, the SwiftUI player, all of it. I pulled out what worked, what didn't, and what patterns I want to carry forward.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The biggest shift is that I'm going fully self-hosted. I spent so much time last year fighting with Spotify's API, getting rejected by OverDrive, Audible, and Hoopla, trying to find some platform that would let me control playback at the segment level. None of them do. And Spotify's ToS blocked the auto-profanity detection I built with OpenAI. So I'm done trying to make third-party platforms work. For the MVP I'm using LibriVox public domain audiobooks — they're free, have an API, and the audio files are hosted on Archive.org permanently. That gives me everything I need to prove the concept without licensing headaches.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The tech stack is completely different from where I started. Backend is Django with Django REST Framework — I picked it for the admin panel, the django-organizations library for households later, and the strong audio processing ecosystem. The admin frontend is a React SPA with wavesurfer.js for the waveform tagging tool. And the iOS app is SwiftUI with AVFoundation, which I'm excited about because the Audio-Player prototype I built already proved that AVPlayer works for what I need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I designed the full database schema, every API endpoint, the iOS screen-by-screen navigation, the React admin component structure, infrastructure and deployment, LibriVox integration details, the audio pipeline, DRM strategy, and legal considerations. The plan has 12 detailed sections covering everything. I even designed a rip-out strategy for LibriVox so when I eventually move to publisher content, I just delete one adapter class and a couple admin endpoints and everything else keeps working.

                <p>
                    One of the things I'm most excited about is the LLM pre-screening pipeline. Remember how the old Tkinter app used the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio and scan for profanity? I'm doing the same thing but fully local now. faster-whisper for speech-to-text with word-level timestamps, and then Ollama running a local LLM for deeper content analysis — violence, sexual content, crude humor, stuff the word list can't catch. The AI creates suggested filter segments and then a human admin reviews and confirms them in the tagging tool. No cloud APIs, no ToS issues, no file size limits.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I also restructured the project into separate repos — one for the backend, one for the iOS app, and this dev log moved into the parent repo as its own thing. Each repo has independent git history and CI/CD. The parent repo just holds the project plan and documentation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm honestly feeling really good about where things are. The plan is solid, it accounts for the lessons from every prototype I've built, and it's scoped properly — Phase 1 is just playback with real-time segment skipping, the tagging tool, and LibriVox content. No payments, no households, no store. Just the core feature. I'm ready to start writing code.

                    School is picking up so I'm going to be holding off on this project for a little bit. I'll still work on it here and there but I need to make time for my course work. I'm also frustrated with the delays caused by getting data from mongodb. I think I'm going to switch to MySQL on the server. I thought that MongoDB was going to be nice because it removes a little bit of the hassle of designing and maintaining the database, but it is just so slow.

                    The prototype app is coming along pretty well. I've set it up so that it pull the finished books from the server and displays them in a list. I'm working on integrating it with spotify controls and then from there I'll work on using the filters I created. I want it to work like VidAngel where the user is able to toggle which filters they want on and off. I'll have to create a thread that is monitoring the position in the audio that will then trigger the skip when the next filter position is found.

                    I feel like I've made it far enough through the course that I've now started working on building the actual app. I've built a small prototype to connect to Spotify from an app. That works pretty easy. Now I'm working on getting the data from my database. I was trying really hard to find a good way to integrate MongoDB with X-Code, but finally stopped that. I built out the API to interact with the API, I just need to pull the data from the API, rather than creating an entirely new way to interact with the DB.

                    It's been a whirlwind of a few weeks. I have mainly been working on the swift course, when I have time, but its been pretty rough. I haven't had much time to devote to the project, but my goal has been just to code everyday. So everyday, even if its only for 15 minutes, I have been working on the swift course and trying to get it finished. Swift encompasses so much that I want to finish the course before I start the audio nexus app. I want to make sure that I'm not just throwing something together but that I'm following best practices for swift. My goal is to finish this course by the end of December so that I can get back to this project in full force.

                    This really shouldn't bother me... but it does. For some reason my github commits aren't showing up on the commit tracking graphic. So on there it doesn't show that I've coded at all since the end of November. Its silly but it was my way of visually seeing that I've been coding as close to daily as I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just figured out what is going on. But I'm not sure how to fix it. All the commits from my Mac are not being counted towards my repo counts. But I'm not sure how to fix it.

                    I fixed the issues I ran into the other day. I know have the buttons skip forward/back 2 or 10 seconds, the increment decrement buttons support holding it down,  I created a language filter for a podcast. The updates to the increment buttons made it pretty easy to get the tag start and end to the right position. I still want to find a way to automate the language filter, but that'll be a project for later. The desktop software for creating the filters is pretty much done. There are lots of features that still need to be created, but its functional enough that I've moved back to the iOS app. Right now I'm working on finishing a Udemy course about Swift and SwiftUI. So far I've enjoyed improving on my Swift and SwiftUI skills.

                    So I went back and added the buttons to skip backward or forward 2 seconds. I also updated the increment and decrement tag start and tag end buttons so that the user can hold the button down to move faster. I also updated the play from tag start/end to actually play from the value displayed. These make it easier to create and adjust the tag as possible. I tried working on storing the Spotify Device IDs but it won't work quite how I hoped. The API from spotify only gives me the devices that the user currently has open. So to make it work the user has to have it open and playing for the API to correctly identify the device I'm targeting. I may still be able to store the data and let the user select which device to use, but no matter what, they have to open spotify before I can make it play. The Web API from spotify is basically just a remote control.

                    So the desktop app if pretty much done. There are some optimization and functionality I'd like to add eventually, but it is working enough that I'm going to move on. Right now I've compromised with myself, the perfectionist part of myself wants to just keep working on this until its perfect, but I just keep thinking of cool things to add, so its time to move on. One of the biggest issues right now is that for it to play any audio I have to have spotify running and playing when I initially boot up the software. The API to get devices from spotify only returns devices with spotify open. I want to eventually add the ability for the user to select which device for playback, and save their devices to the database, that way even if its not currently playing the desktop app has its information. I'll get to it eventually, its on my ToDo list.

                    I'm going to move on to building the app. There will always be things to improve and iterate on, but I want to have a 'finished' product to show. I think that if I can get the app published the feedback from users will really help me understand what is important to the user. There are things that seem important to me, but they might just not be that big of a deal to someone using the software.

                <p>
                    Well I have to walk back what I was saying about moving on. I just sat down and tried to create a filter for a podcast, and it is pretty messed up. The system 'works' but it doesn't work how it needs to work. I have to add a way to store and access the devices. Right now if I pause the audio and wait for too long then spotify api doesn't recognize it as an active device and you can't resume playback with how I have it set up. I also need a skip back 10 seconds, skip back 2 seconds, forward 2 seconds, and forward 10 seconds to allow for better accuracy when trying to create the tags. The play from location on the tag creation column doesn't seem to be working. It doesn't actually change where its playing from, it just stays at whatever point it already was set, even after I've changed what the input says. Its not being correctly passed. I also need to update the increment/decrement buttons. They need to have the ability to hold down to increment or decrement faster. Have to just furiously click to try and move it just isn't working.

                    Desktop application is almost done. I've finished the tag creation process and finished a search functionality. I'm now working on a way to move the books from search to ToDo and from ToDo to In Progress or Finished. I just need a way to move the books around as needed. I also need a way to retrigger the get books from the database. I want the application to update pretty seamlessly. I also want the tag to be not only added to the database when I click save, but also added to the middle column of the book view. Right now I just need to be able to trigger the update in the background so that it updates it but doesn't cause it to feel really slow.

                    I'm not going to start rebuilding the desktop app, but I'm not super happy with its feel. I just think that python was the wrong choice for a desktop application. I like using python for the functionality but for actually building the UI it just feels clunky. I want it to feel like a web app with that smoothness and responsiveness, but what I'm using just doesn't feel quite like that. I've heard Electron is a pretty good idea, or QT with C++. I originally started this project using C++ but decided to transition to python. But when I inevitable rebuild the desktop app, I'll use a different stack to do that. I'll keep the server in Python and FastAPI but the actual desktop app with be built with something else. But for now I'm just going to get this working and finished, so that I can finally work on the user facing app. I'm really excited to get started on that. I really enjoy Swift and like programming in it.

                    I migrated all the data to MongoDB. It is pretty slow, so I might migrate to a server side SQL database to speed up the queries. Right now there is a pretty noticeable lag between when you start the program up and when it actually begins to function. I like the MongoDB because it helps keep the server clean. Its more of an api gateway that directs the traffic to the correct resource, but if speed continues to be an issue I'll probably change it.

I'm still moving forward wit Spotify because at the very least it will allow me to build a beta version and get user feedback. Spotify has its drawbacks I've talked about earlier, but it's the easiest to access currently.

                    The admin portal is coming along very nicely. I am integrating it with the api I created. I am able to find the specific podcast, song, or audiobook, start playback, pause playback, and seek to specific position. I am working on a login system that requires the user to login to the desktop app, this is mainly to either request Spotify authentication or renew the stored authentication data. I mostly worked on the getting the login screen functioning and getting it to successfully block users from accessing any other pages until they login. That process is done, so I'm now going to get it to validate the user data and to get the correct spotify data.

                    The admin portal is all framed out, at least the books section. I will go back and work on the users and customers tabs later, but for now I want to finish this part. So now that the admin portal is built I need to finish the API. I need to be able to control playback and create contact tags. I also need to start thinking about the database I want to use. I want to pull the data in from the API so I need to think about how the data will be stored. One of the next hurdles is creating the automatic language filter. Right now the system I have created relies on sending the audio file to the OPENAI API and getting timestamp word locations, and then processing that data to identify words that need to be filtered, but that won't work with the Spotify API. Spotify prohibits sending the data to an AI. So I'll need to figure out another way to auto-filter the language, or just scratch that for the moment and create all manual tags.

I've also began laying out the work space section, where I'll be able to listen to the audiobooks and actually create the different filters. So far none of it is functional, I'm just building the bones, but it's looking good.

                    The Admin Homepage is coming along pretty well. I found a wrapper for Kivy called KivyMD. It just allows for a few improvements to the UI and supports things likes lists. It took a little research but I was able to dynamically create the lists of books. Each page pulls in data from a data source and creates a list item. This part is still in the works, has a bunch of issues to workout but I was able to dynamically create a book view page. The page is then populated with data dynamically depending on the book selected. The main issue I'm having is the created screen is inheriting things from its parent. So the navigation bar of the parent is showing up in the child and causing a bunch of issues. I think I'll need to create another screen that is managed by the parent screen manager. This screen will be hidden until a book is selected.

                    So for now I'm moving forward with the Spotify API. Working with that API will allow me to gain access to the data I need to build a working app. There are several things about it that I really don't like. With the Spotify the user is only able to access 15 hours of audiobooks a month and for an additional 10 hours it costs $12.99. The also will not allow me to incorporate other streaming services, if I go with Spotify I can only use Spotify. Reading through their terms of service I'm still pretty unclear if I'll be able to charge a subscription fee for my app to cover costs of making the filters, hosting the server, etc. So I may be able to build a prototype and proof of concept with their API but long term I'm unhappy with Spotify as the data source for the audiobooks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have thought about reaching out to different publishers to see if I could become a retailer for them and just sell the audiobooks through my website. Or set it up like the library where I buy a certain number of copies of each book and the user can check it out. But I would need to do more research to know if that approach would be a viable option.

                <p>
                    I'm also working on project design and planning. Up until now the project has been very free flowing and all tracked in my head. With trying to build such a large scale (to me) system things just need to be more organized. I like the idea of a scrum set-up and am working on creating the user stories to meet the system requirements. I'm also sitting down and creating the wire frames for the admin desktop software and the user app. I really haven't spent much time coding on the app in the last two weeks. I've been really busy with school, but I'm also taking the time to plan and prep for the project. I believe that having a well designed plan will help the implementation go a lot faster.

                <p>
                    On the coding side of things I started creating the API that will allow the desktop application and the iPhone app to interact with the data and with the Spotify API. I'm using FastAPI which is new to me. So far things have been going pretty well. But like I said above I've kind of halted progress on that for a little to finish planning and designing the app. I want to make sure I'm not just throwing code at the wall and hoping it creates something cool.

                <p>
                    Right off the bat. I got denied access to OverDrive. They said I have to be associated with one of their partners. So I have reached out to the Mid-Continent Library to see if I they would allow me to become a partner. I originally was operating under the assumption that Libby as an independent company, but they are owned and operated by OverDrive. I assumed that because as app like Libby was accessing their data I would also be able to, but since they own it, its different.

                    I began searching for other companies that allow users to access audiobooks. I found one called Hoopla, that is essentially a Libby clone. I found the company that allows them to access the digital content, Midwest Tapes. But I found out that they are actually the owners of Hoopla and they don't have a public API. I may reach out to them and just see if I can request access, but they don't publicize an API.

                    I am also looking at how to incorporate Audible, but they don't have a public API. I found an API that is trying to document the private Audible API but its very incomplete. I was able to do an API call that returned all of my audiobooks. But as soon as I tried to hit any of the other endpoints I just got access denied/rejected responses. I was worried about trying it too much because I don't want to get my account shut down. I am going to try reaching out to Amazon to see if I can gain access to the API. Even if its a paid API it would help me move forward.

                    I found a library called Kivvy. So far its really cool. It allows me to create modern desktop apps that are touch enabled and cross platform. I'll be curios what it looks like when I load it up on my Mac, because the TKinter GUI looked horrible on Mac. So far I've just been reading their docs and following a few little tutorials/demos that they have. I'll start on the actual GUI soon.

                <p>
                    Right now I'm feeling a little discouraged because its proving so hard to gain access to Audiobooks. I've got most of the rest of the app pretty well sorted at this point. The backend won't take much more work to complete, the frontend needs to be built but it shouldn't take too long, and the database design/deployment will also be pretty easy. At least from my current perspective the biggest hurdle to getting this app built and finished is finding a way to source the Audiobooks. Once I can figure that out I really do believe that the project will move along pretty quickly.

                    I have redone the filtering system and found a really good way to track the time that the different content tags are being created. I was making it too complicated before. I had overlooked the pygame method that just allows you to tap into the current location in the sound. I had to do a little manipulation to get the returned value into a format that made sense for the user to see, but pretty simple now.

                    I was refactoring the code to accommodate an MVC design pattern. I refactored a large majority of the code, but have put a pause on it for now. I want to finish the new GUI and learn more about Kivvy before I do too much more refactoring. I think that the switch to Kivvy will allow me to reassess how tags are being created, how I display the filtering information, and how the audio is being interacted with. There will still be lots that needs to be refactored but it can wait for now.

                    Learning Swift is going well. I just created a simple chat app that allows two users to chat back and forth from different devices. I still really like Swift. Swift and App Design are really helping me with my object oriented programming. Which is another reason I'm excited to revisit refactoring my code. It'll be nice to be able to approach it in a more mindful manner.

                    I've done some pretty heavy refactoring. I'm trying to conform to MVC design pattern. The admin side of this is being built with Tkinter, and I'm starting to think it's a mistake. It could just be that I'm not the best at building GUI's with Tkinter, but I'm thinking of switching the admin side to a web app. I prefer working with Flask to tkinter so if feels like it would be a better fit, and I'll need to build an API endpoint for the iOS app to hit. I may look at other GUI libraries, but I don't like how I have to build the whole front end using python, I like having the HTML templates and being able to pass data into the template. I also think that working with the audio may be 'easier' in a web app.

                    I'm also waiting to hear back from OverDrive. OverDrive is the service most of the libraries in the united states use for their digital assets. I had to apply to gain developer access, but once approved I'll be able to build a frontend similar to Libby that allows the user to search, place holds, check out books, and then listen to their audiobooks. As part of the application they asked me to provide a key contact at the library I want to access, so I'm also waiting on a message back from Mid-Continent Library.

                    This project is going pretty slow right now. We finally decided to purchase a Mac Mini so I could start learning Swift and to develop iOS apps. So far Swift is surprisingly similar to C++. The structure and style reminds me a lot of what I was learning with C++ but has a similar readability to Python.

                    On Audio Nexus I have done some work. I've been working on the tagging system. I've managed to pull out all of the tag data, now I just need to decide how I want to save the data. For now I'll probably save it to a json file. Eventually I'll create a database for the data.

                    I got the content filter tagging system pretty close to being done. The part I'm still struggling with is tracking the correct time. I came up with a pretty good method, but it seems to struggle to create tags that are less than 1 second. It will also really get thrown off the user starts creating a tag while the audio is not playing. I need to figure out a better way to track the elapsed time, tag start time, and tag end time. I also think I need to break the tag creation off into its own class.

                    So I've just been working on learning C++. So far its going pretty well. I think I still prefer Python overall but I do like C++. I do like that variables have stated types, the memory allocation aspect is interesting. It'll be interesting to learn more about it memory allocation to be able to help cut the bloat of my programs. One of the things I dislike about C++ is that arrays have static sizes and can't be expanded on the fly. Maybe there are more things I can learn about dynamic memory to work with arrays in a way that is more familiar.

                    I haven't spent much time working on audiobook nexus recently. But for the project I want to use C++ to create the admin center where admins can create the filters for new audiobooks. I will either create a web application with Python and Flask, or possible FastHTML or Django to learn a new web framework. Or, and this is what I'd rather do, is build the user end of the application with Swift and create an app on iPhone. But that desire is dependent on me buying a Mac. So we'll see.

                <h2>What is Audio Nexus?</h2>
                <p>
                    Audio Nexus is an audiobook filtering software. The idea was inspired by services like VidAngel, Enjoy, and ClearPlay that allow users to enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows without all the swearing or explicit content. I love to read and wanted to create a service that did the same for audiobooks. So Audio Nexus was born. This project will allow users to listen to audiobooks and filter out explicit language and other explicit content.

                <h2>What is this site?</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is essentially a blog about Audio Nexus. I will use it to post updates about the project, issues I'm running into, and give insights into my though process as the project develops and takes shape.

                <h2>How is the project going?</h2>
                <p>
                    Audio Nexus is taking shape nicely. I have been programming the project using python. I created a basic media player that allows me to load in the audio file. I then send the file to OpenAI with the API to create timestamps/transcript for the audio. From there I process the timestamps to create a language filter automatically. But I'm realizing that I will probably need to create an easy way for human review. Not only to tag missed explicit language, but more importantly to tag other explicit content. I don't want to rely on an algorithms to try and create a filter for sexual or crude content. They are so subjective and don't have a clear cut start and end. So like, VidAngel I'm going to have to use human review and intuition to mark unsafe content.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So far the project is working okay with python. So I may still build the end user software with python. But right now using python to create the tags is pretty messy. I've been doing some research on which programming language is best when working with audio and the general consensus is C++. So I think I'm going to try and build the Admin side of the project with C++. But I've never worked with C++ so it'll be an interesting transition and learning process.
