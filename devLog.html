                    I migrated all the data to MongoDB. It is pretty slow, so I might migrate to a server side SQL database to speed up the queries. Right now there is a pretty noticeable lag between when you start the program up and when it actually begins to function. I like the MongoDB because it helps keep the server clean. Its more of an api gateway that directs the traffic to the correct resource, but if speed continues to be an issue I'll probably change it.

                    The admin software, at least the filter creation aspect, is almost done. I am working on the tag creation system and then I just need to figure out the way I want to move books from Requested, To Do, In Progress, to Finished. After that I'll just need to actually create a few filters, and then make the iPhone app.

                    I'm going to reach out to Audible and see if I can gain access to their API, and at what cost. I'm still moving forward wit Spotify because at the very least it will allow me to build a beta version and get user feedback. Spotify has its drawbacks I've talked about earlier, but it's the easiest to access currently.

                    The admin portal is coming along very nicely. I am integrating it with the api I created. I am able to find the specific podcast, song, or audiobook, start playback, pause playback, and seek to specific position. I am working on a login system that requires the user to login to the desktop app, this is mainly to either request Spotify authentication or renew the stored authentication data. I mostly worked on the getting the login screen functioning and getting it to successfully block users from accessing any other pages until they login. That process is done, so I'm now going to get it to validate the user data and to get the correct spotify data.

                    The admin portal is all framed out, at least the books section. I will go back and work on the users and customers tabs later, but for now I want to finish this part. So now that the admin portal is built I need to finish the API. I need to be able to control playback and create contact tags. I also need to start thinking about the database I want to use. I want to pull the data in from the API so I need to think about how the data will be stored. One of the next hurdles is creating the automatic language filter. Right now the system I have created relies on sending the audio file to the OPENAI API and getting timestamp word locations, and then processing that data to identify words that need to be filtered, but that won't work with the Spotify API. Spotify prohibits sending the data to an AI. So I'll need to figure out another way to auto-filter the language, or just scratch that for the moment and create all manual tags.

                    I've been making some pretty good progress on the Admin Portal. I'm now able to correctly display the different screens, load in book data, and display some filter data. I've also began laying out the work space section, where I'll be able to listen to the audiobooks and actually create the different filters. So far none of it is functional, I'm just building the bones, but it's looking good.

                    The Admin Homepage is coming along pretty well. I found a wrapper for Kivy called KivyMD. It just allows for a few improvements to the UI and supports things likes lists. It took a little research but I was able to dynamically create the lists of books. Each page pulls in data from a data source and creates a list item. This part is still in the works, has a bunch of issues to workout but I was able to dynamically create a book view page. The page is then populated with data dynamically depending on the book selected. The main issue I'm having is the created screen is inheriting things from its parent. So the navigation bar of the parent is showing up in the child and causing a bunch of issues. I think I'll need to create another screen that is managed by the parent screen manager. This screen will be hidden until a book is selected.

                    So that I don't forget. I'm starting to look at becoming an audiobook marketplace. I'm working to figure out what that would take and if it would be worth it.

                    So for now I'm moving forward with the Spotify API. Working with that API will allow me to gain access to the data I need to build a working app. There are several things about it that I really don't like. With the Spotify the user is only able to access 15 hours of audiobooks a month and for an additional 10 hours it costs $12.99. The also will not allow me to incorporate other streaming services, if I go with Spotify I can only use Spotify. Reading through their terms of service I'm still pretty unclear if I'll be able to charge a subscription fee for my app to cover costs of making the filters, hosting the server, etc. So I may be able to build a prototype and proof of concept with their API but long term I'm unhappy with Spotify as the data source for the audiobooks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have thought about reaching out to different publishers to see if I could become a retailer for them and just sell the audiobooks through my website. Or set it up like the library where I buy a certain number of copies of each book and the user can check it out. But I would need to do more research to know if that approach would be a viable option.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm also working on project design and planning. Up until now the project has been very free flowing and all tracked in my head. With trying to build such a large scale (to me) system things just need to be more organized. I like the idea of a scrum set-up and am working on creating the user stories to meet the system requirements. I'm also sitting down and creating the wire frames for the admin desktop software and the user app. I really haven't spent much time coding on the app in the last two weeks. I've been really busy with school, but I'm also taking the time to plan and prep for the project. I believe that having a well designed plan will help the implementation go a lot faster. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the coding side of things I started creating the API that will allow the desktop application and the iPhone app to interact with the data and with the Spotify API. I'm using FastAPI which is new to me. So far things have been going pretty well. But like I said above I've kind of halted progress on that for a little to finish planning and designing the app. I want to make sure I'm not just throwing code at the wall and hoping it creates something cool.

                <h2>API Access</h2>
                <p>
                    Right off the bat. I got denied access to OverDrive. They said I have to be associated with one of their partners. So I have reached out to the Mid-Continent Library to see if I they would allow me to become a partner. I originally was operating under the assumption that Libby as an independent company, but they are owned and operated by OverDrive. I assumed that because as app like Libby was accessing their data I would also be able to, but since they own it, its different.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I began searching for other companies that allow users to access audiobooks. I found one called Hoopla, that is essentially a Libby clone. I found the company that allows them to access the digital content, Midwest Tapes. But I found out that they are actually the owners of Hoopla and they don't have a public API. I may reach out to them and just see if I can request access, but they don't publicize an API.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am also looking at how to incorporate Audible, but they don't have a public API. I found an API that is trying to document the private Audible API but its very incomplete. I was able to do an API call that returned all of my audiobooks. But as soon as I tried to hit any of the other endpoints I just got access denied/rejected responses. I was worried about trying it too much because I don't want to get my account shut down. I am going to try reaching out to Amazon to see if I can gain access to the API. Even if its a paid API it would help me move forward.
                </p>
                <h2>Admin Desktop Application</h2>
                <p>
                    I found a library called Kivvy. So far its really cool. It allows me to create modern desktop apps that are touch enabled and cross platform. I'll be curios what it looks like when I load it up on my Mac, because the TKinter GUI looked horrible on Mac. So far I've just been reading their docs and following a few little tutorials/demos that they have. I'll start on the actual GUI soon.
                </p>
                <h2>General Update</h2>
                <p>
                    Right now I'm feeling a little discouraged because its proving so hard to gain access to Audiobooks. I've got most of the rest of the app pretty well sorted at this point. The backend won't take much more work to complete, the frontend needs to be built but it shouldn't take too long, and the database design/deployment will also be pretty easy. At least from my current perspective the biggest hurdle to getting this app built and finished is finding a way to source the Audiobooks. Once I can figure that out I really do believe that the project will move along pretty quickly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have redone the filtering system and found a really good way to track the time that the different content tags are being created. I was making it too complicated before. I had overlooked the pygame method that just allows you to tap into the current location in the sound. I had to do a little manipulation to get the returned value into a format that made sense for the user to see, but pretty simple now.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I was refactoring the code to accommodate an MVC design pattern. I refactored a large majority of the code, but have put a pause on it for now. I want to finish the new GUI and learn more about Kivvy before I do too much more refactoring. I think that the switch to Kivvy will allow me to reassess how tags are being created, how I display the filtering information, and how the audio is being interacted with. There will still be lots that needs to be refactored but it can wait for now.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Learning Swift is going well. I just created a simple chat app that allows two users to chat back and forth from different devices. I still really like Swift. Swift and App Design are really helping me with my object oriented programming. Which is another reason I'm excited to revisit refactoring my code. It'll be nice to be able to approach it in a more mindful manner.

                    I've done some pretty heavy refactoring. I'm trying to conform to MVC design pattern. The admin side of this is being built with Tkinter, and I'm starting to think it's a mistake. It could just be that I'm not the best at building GUI's with Tkinter, but I'm thinking of switching the admin side to a web app. I prefer working with Flask to tkinter so if feels like it would be a better fit, and I'll need to build an API endpoint for the iOS app to hit. I may look at other GUI libraries, but I don't like how I have to build the whole front end using python, I like having the HTML templates and being able to pass data into the template. I also think that working with the audio may be 'easier' in a web app.

                    I'm also waiting to hear back from OverDrive. OverDrive is the service most of the libraries in the united states use for their digital assets. I had to apply to gain developer access, but once approved I'll be able to build a frontend similar to Libby that allows the user to search, place holds, check out books, and then listen to their audiobooks. As part of the application they asked me to provide a key contact at the library I want to access, so I'm also waiting on a message back from Mid-Continent Library.

                    This project is going pretty slow right now. We finally decided to purchase a Mac Mini so I could start learning Swift and to develop iOS apps. So far Swift is surprisingly similar to C++. The structure and style reminds me a lot of what I was learning with C++ but has a similar readability to Python.

                    On Audio Nexus I have done some work. I've been working on the tagging system. I've managed to pull out all of the tag data, now I just need to decide how I want to save the data. For now I'll probably save it to a json file. Eventually I'll create a database for the data.

                <p>
                    I got the content filter tagging system pretty close to being done. The part I'm still struggling with is tracking the correct time. I came up with a pretty good method, but it seems to struggle to create tags that are less than 1 second. It will also really get thrown off the user starts creating a tag while the audio is not playing. I need to figure out a better way to track the elapsed time, tag start time, and tag end time. I also think I need to break the tag creation off into its own class.

                    So I've just been working on learning C++. So far its going pretty well. I think I still prefer Python overall but I do like C++. I do like that variables have stated types, the memory allocation aspect is interesting. It'll be interesting to learn more about it memory allocation to be able to help cut the bloat of my programs. One of the things I dislike about C++ is that arrays have static sizes and can't be expanded on the fly. Maybe there are more things I can learn about dynamic memory to work with arrays in a way that is more familiar.

                <p>
                    I haven't spent much time working on audiobook nexus recently. But for the project I want to use C++ to create the admin center where admins can create the filters for new audiobooks. I will either create a web application with Python and Flask, or possible FastHTML or Django to learn a new web framework. Or, and this is what I'd rather do, is build the user end of the application with Swift and create an app on iPhone. But that desire is dependent on me buying a Mac. So we'll see.

                <h2>What is Audio Nexus?</h2>
                <p>
                    Audio Nexus is an audiobook filtering software. The idea was inspired by services like VidAngel, Enjoy, and ClearPlay that allow users to enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows without all the swearing or explicit content. I love to read and wanted to create a service that did the same for audiobooks. So Audio Nexus was born. This project will allow users to listen to audiobooks and filter out explicit language and other explicit content. 
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>What is this site?</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is essentially a blog about Audio Nexus. I will use it to post updates about the project, issues I'm running into, and give insights into my though process as the project develops and takes shape.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>How is the project going?</h2>
                <p>
                    Audio Nexus is taking shape nicely. I have been programming the project using python. I created a basic media player that allows me to load in the audio file. I then send the file to OpenAI with the API to create timestamps/transcript for the audio. From there I process the timestamps to create a language filter automatically. But I'm realizing that I will probably need to create an easy way for human review. Not only to tag missed explicit language, but more importantly to tag other explicit content. I don't want to rely on an algorithms to try and create a filter for sexual or crude content. They are so subjective and don't have a clear cut start and end. So like, VidAngel I'm going to have to use human review and intuition to mark unsafe content.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So far the project is working okay with python. So I may still build the end user software with python. But right now using python to create the tags is pretty messy. I've been doing some research on which programming language is best when working with audio and the general consensus is C++. So I think I'm going to try and build the Admin side of the project with C++. But I've never worked with C++ so it'll be an interesting transition and learning process.
